			purpose = <"To record details of evidence in support of a clinical assertion, either as a summary of data available in other (often OBSERVATION class) archetypes, or when the original observational data is not available to the application.">
			use = <"Use to record an explicit details about evidence in support of a clinical assertion, such as a problem/diagnosis, adverse reaction risk, health risk assessment, or contraindication.

This archetype has been designed to allow recording details about evidence that support any clinical assertion. It is intended to be nested within a SLOT in the EVALUATION.problem_diagnosis, EVALUATION.adverse_reaction_risk, EVALUATION.health_risk, EVALUATION.contraindication, or similar summary archetypes, where the name of the assertion has already been specified in the EVALUATION, in order to extend its content with this additional and optional dataset. While links within the openEHR Reference Model allow for this linkage to data held elsewhere within the health record, this archetype has been developed to make this functionality explicit, and to enable clinical visibiity and review of this data, where it may be relevant in a template or specification.

The evidence can be entered into the archetype, or the citations can be used to explicitly point to data with the extent of the health record.">
